        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">
            In 2018, my mom finally heard the words she had been waiting to hear since I left home for college 6 years earlier "I am moving!"  <br><br> Much to her dismay, I was not moving back home to Seattle, but instead moving the opposite direction to Boston for a new tech roll.   In my free time I love coding! I work seamlessly in Python and SQL and am actively learning HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript.  I built this webstie myself using the Flask Framework; please reachout if you have any pointers for me!
